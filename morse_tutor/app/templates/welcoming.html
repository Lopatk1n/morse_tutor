        <h2 class='subtitleCard'>How to start?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class='cardTextleft _animated'>
        <p>To start feeling Morse code, it is necessary to evoke associations in your head between a certain set of sounds (a sequence of dots and dashes) and the so-called "chants".
        To do this, you should use a mnemonic memorization technique.</p>
        <p>If you press a key <b style='color: #05386B'>~</b>, you will see a table. Let's take an example: the letter A has an encoding Â·- (one short sound and then a long one). And it sounds like "ti - taaa".</p>
        <p> To associate a letter with its sound, need to use an intermediate link - a chant. The chant for the letter A is a-GAIN. A short a, and then a long GAAAAIN.</p>
    </div>

    <div class='card _animated'>
        <h2 class='subtitleCard'>So...</h2>
    </div>
    <div class='cardText _animated'>
        Turn up the sound and press the <b style='color: #05386B'>space</b> bar. This key is used as a telegraph key. You can try to reproduce the sound of any character. Sing a chant at the same time. With time and a lot of practice, you will begin to associate morse sounds with this chant, and as a result, with the necessary symbol.
