# Morse-tutor.su

This is a web application made on python (Django) and native javascript. It is a Morse code simulator, which is suitable as for beginners who want to learn how to recognize the code, and also for more experienced people who want to increase receive speed and quality of transmitting. In this version there are three training modes that develop all the necessary skills to work with Morse code. Interaction takes place using the keyboard, so the application is not adapted for mobile phones. The idea of the project is simple. I served in the army as a radio operator and I had to learn Morse code. So may say that I have some expertise in this matter. I just haven't found any really handy tools. All that the Internet could offer was either old desktop applications with a minimum of functionality with a very complex interface, or various videos on YouTube, which in principle will not help in mastering Morse code. Well, that's why I decided to make my own application, with the necessary functions, but at the same time with a casual interface. If you are interested in this topic, but you are not ready to buy or assemble radio equipment and related tools on your own, but you are interested in trying, then visit https://morse-tutor.su
##### I don't give comments on how to install the project locally, because it won't work without a database anyway.
